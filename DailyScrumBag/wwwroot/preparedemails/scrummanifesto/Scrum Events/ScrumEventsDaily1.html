<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Daily Scrum</h3>
<p>The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team. The Daily Scrum is
    held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This
    optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum
    and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each
    day to reduce complexity.</p>
