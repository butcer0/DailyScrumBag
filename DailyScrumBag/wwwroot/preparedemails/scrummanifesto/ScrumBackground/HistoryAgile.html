<h3>History of the Agile Manifesto</h3>
<p>The Agile Manifesto and the Twelve Principles of Agile Software were the consequences of industry frustration in the 1990s. The enormous time lag between business requirements (the applications and features customers were requesting) and the delivery of technology that answered those needs, led to the cancelling of many projects. Business, requirements, and customer requisites changed during this lag time, and the final product did not meet the then current needs. The software development models of the day, led by the Waterfall model, were not meeting the demand for speed and did not take advantage of just how quickly software could be altered.</p>
<p>“We are uncovering better ways of developing
        software by doing it and helping others do it.
        Through this work we have come to value:</p>
<p>“Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
        Working software over comprehensive documentation
        Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        Responding to change over following a plan</p>
<p>“That is, while there is value in the items on
        the right, we value the items on the left more.”</p>
