<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Sprint Backlog</h3>
<h4>Increment</h4>
<p>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the
    value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must
    be “Done,” which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition
    of “Done.” An increment is a body of inspectable, done work that supports empiricism at the
    end of the Sprint. The increment is a step toward a vision or goal. The increment must be in
    useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it.</p>
